# GNOME Shell extension - Youversion votd image

Bring some color to your GNOME desktop by syncing your desktop and lockscreen wallpapers with today's Youversion's verse of the day image with this extension. The intention of this extension is to just do what it needs to do and stay out of your way, with a few optional features to improve quality-of-life.

## Features

* Automatically sets the Youversion [Verse of the Day image](https://www.bible.com/verse-of-the-day) as both lock screen and desktop wallpapers
* Only attempts to download wallpapers when they have been updated - doesn't poll continuously
* Shuffle/randomise wallpapers at adjustable intervals (including from your stored Bing images)
* Image gallery to view, select and curate stored images
* Optionally delete old images after a week, or you can keep (and curate) them forever
* Override the lockscreen blur (NEW: lockscreen blur is now dynamic!)
* Language support: English (en), German (de), Dutch (nl), Italian (it), Polish (pl), Chinese (zh_CN, zh_TW), French (fr_FR), Portuguese (pt, pt_BR), Ukrainian (uk), Russian (ru_RU), Spanish (es), Korean (ko), Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Norwegian Bokm√•l (nb) & Nynorsk (nn), Swedish (sv), Arabic (ar), Hungarian (hu), Japanese (ja), Czech (cs_CZ), Finnish (fi_FI) and Turkish (tr) - a HUGE thanks to the translators
* Image preview in menus & ability to manually set wallpapers individually or copy image to clipboard
* A selection of different theme-aware indicator (tray) icons to choose (or hide it completely)

## TODO

* Scale image so it fits nicely on the screen
* Remove all requests to bing
* Update metadata.json

## Requirements

GNOME 3.36+ or 40+ (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later, older versions of the extension work with 3.18+, but are no longer supported).
